## [v1.0.3] - 2025-09-22
### Added
- Added some [Shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to the `README.md` Tech Stack section because I want to add a bit of *kawaii* on my README file.

## [v1.0.2] - 2025-09-15
### Fixed
- Changed *Yay Area* footer text to *East Yay*, to specify that I reside in the 510. I also linked to the Wikipedia page for *San Francisco Bay Area* for those who don't know what *Yay Area* or *"East Yay"* refers to.
- Split `index.html` file into partial files: `head.html`, `header.html`, `footer.html`, `js-footer.html`, so that it saves time when updating and also exactly matches `single.html`

### Added
- Added **Not By AI** banner at the footer, linking to [Not By AI](https://notbyai.fyi)
- Customized **Not by AI** banner to unset all the default PaperCSS styling and to keep the banner in its original state, per [Not By AI Usage Guidelines](https://notbyai.fyi/help/guidelines)

## [v1.0.1] — 2025-09-11
### Fixed
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` was missing in both `index.html` and `single.html` head tags, which is why responsiveness wasn't working on mobile phones and tablets. It should work now
- Made the site title clickable to the Home page

### Added
- Home link in footer along with `Colophon` and `Changelog`
- Proper anchor styling via `.no-underline` class in `custom.css`

---

## [v1.0.0] – 2025-09-10
