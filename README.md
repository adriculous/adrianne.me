# 🍂 index.adrianne 🍂

Welcome to the GitHub repo for [index.adrianne](https://adrianne.me) — my cozy digital corner on the indie web! This site also serves as my extended digital *business card*.

This is a personal *link-in-bio* homepage. It may expand into a full-blown site collective hub, but as of its initial launching, it's primarily a *link-in-bio* page.

## 📝 Notes

- The site is designed as a single-page layout using Hugo’s flexible structure.  
- Pages are written in Markdown and use the same layout for consistency.  
- Styling is a mix of PaperCSS and custom mobile-first tweaks for seasonal aesthetics 🍂.  
- Some layout and code fixes were assisted by ChatGPT (*Ai-chan* ✨), with full human review, local testing, and hands-on learning.

## 🧡 About This Site

This site was created as a personal link-in-bio space on the web, blending cozy vibes, autumn colors, and hand-written content. I may expand this into a full-blown site collective hub, but for now, just a link-in-bio page. Hope you enjoy exploring my (chaotic) creations!
