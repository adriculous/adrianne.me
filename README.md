# 🍂 index.adrianne 🍂

Welcome to the GitHub repo for [index.adrianne](https://adrianne.me) — my cozy digital corner on the indie web! This site also serves as my extended digital *business card*.

This is a personal *link-in-bio* homepage, made with:

- 🛠️ [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) – static site generator
- 🎨 [PaperCSS](https://getpapercss.com/) – classless CSS framework
- 💻 [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) – cloud hosting
- 🗂️ [GitHub](https://github.com) – version control

## 📝 Notes

- The site is designed as a single-page layout using Hugo’s flexible structure.  
- Pages are written in Markdown and use the same layout for consistency.  
- Styling is a mix of PaperCSS and custom mobile-first tweaks for seasonal aesthetics 🍂.  
- Some layout and code fixes were assisted by ChatGPT (*Ai-chan* ✨), with full human review, local testing, and hands-on learning.
