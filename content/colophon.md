### ü§ñ A Note on AI & Assistance

Some of the layout, code, and troubleshooting were assisted by *Ai-chan* (my friendly AI assistant a.k.a. ChatGPT), especially as I learned frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Hugo‚Äôs templating system. I review everything, tweak it, test it locally, and learn as I go.

> Using an AI assistant is *not* the same as relying on fully AI-generated code.

You can't just expect an AI to build a full website from one prompt and call it done. Nothing in this world is perfect ‚Äî especially AI. You still need to know your web dev basics (HTML, CSS, JS, frameworks, etc.) and test things locally before launching.

This site is a cozy corner of the indie web ‚Äî made with both heart ‚ù§Ô∏è and help üõ†Ô∏è.
